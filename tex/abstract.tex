The resources required to store and transmit images are huge, making their compression essential. All the efforts made in classical image compression algorithms address the problem from an empiric point of view: experts develop several heuristics to reduce the amount of information needed to represent the image by exploiting imperfections in the human visual system. This way, it is possible to reconstruct it without much perceptible information loss.
The success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision application has been inspiring researchers from the image compression community to try to develop algorithms that learn from data, rather than relying on expert knowledge. So far, these algorithms have not lead to an unquestionable improvement over classical codecs.
The objective of the present work is to study and explore CNN solutions to the challenge of compressing images, aiming to propose a method that outperforms classical codecs. To achieve this goal, the classical compression method JPEG is evaluated in databases commonly used for this type of problem. Next, some preliminary experiments on encoder-decoder CNNs have been performed.
